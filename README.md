## Features

- Multiple college-specific marketplaces with custom theming
- User authentication and profile management

- Category-based browsing
- Shopping cart and checkout
- Messaging system for buyer-seller communication
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unimart.git
cd unimart
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```
npm run dev
```

## Creating a New Marketplace

UniMart is designed to make it easy to create new college-specific marketplaces. The platform uses a modular approach with reusable components and themes.

### Step 1: Define College Theme

Add your college theme to the `collegeThemes.ts` file:

```typescript
// In frontend/src/config/collegeThemes.ts
export const collegeThemes = {
  // ... existing themes
  
  newcollege: {
    name: 'NewCollegeMart',
    colors: {
      primary: '#PrimaryColor',
      secondary: '#SecondaryColor',
      accent: '#AccentColor',
      background: '#BackgroundColor',
      text: '#TextColor',
      error: '#ErrorColor',
      headerBg: '#HeaderColor',
      navBg: '#NavColor',
    },
    logo: '/images/newcollege-logo.png',
    mascot: '/images/newcollege-mascot.png',
    routes: {
      home: '/newcollege',
      market: '/newcollegemart',
    }
  },
};
```

### Step 2: Create Marketplace Page

Create a new marketplace page using the `createMarketplace` utility:

```typescript
// In frontend/src/pages/NewCollegeMartPage.tsx
import React from 'react';
import createMarketplace from '../utils/createMarketplace';

// Optional: Define dummy products or fetch them from an API
const dummyProducts = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "Sample Product",
    price: 45.99,
    image: "https://example.com/product.jpg",
    condition: "New",
    category: "Electronics"
  },
  // ... more products
];

// Create the marketplace page
const NewCollegeMartPage = createMarketplace({
  collegeName: 'newcollege',
  categories: ['Books', 'Electronics', 'Clothing', 'Furniture', 'Other'],
  dummyProducts,
  // Add custom handlers if needed
});

export default NewCollegeMartPage;
```

### Step 3: Add Routes to App.tsx

Update the App.tsx file to include routes for your new marketplace:

```typescript
// In frontend/src/App.tsx
import NewCollegeMartPage from './pages/NewCollegeMartPage';

// Inside the Routes component:
<Routes>
  {/* ... existing routes */}
  
  {/* New College Routes */}
  <Route path="/newcollegemart" element={<NewCollegeMartPage />} />
  <Route path="/newcollege" element={<Navigate to="/newcollegemart" replace />} />
  
  {/* ... other routes */}
</Routes>

// Inside the MarketplaceRouter component:
const MarketplaceRouter = () => {
  // ... existing code
  
  switch (collegeName.toLowerCase()) {
    // ... existing cases
    
    case 'newcollege':
    case 'newcollegemart':
      return <Navigate to="/newcollegemart" replace />;
      
    // ... default case
  }
};
```
