# UniMart Frontend - Next Steps

## What We've Accomplished

1. **Project Structure Setup**
   - Created a React TypeScript project structure
   - Set up essential configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json)
   - Added .gitignore for proper version control

2. **Component Development**
   - Created reusable UI components:
     - Logo component
     - Button component
     - Input component

3. **Page Components**
   - Implemented key pages:
     - HomePage (email validation)
     - VerificationPage (code verification)
     - UnsupportedSchoolPage (list of supported universities)
     - MarketplacePage (protected route for authenticated users)

4. **Routing**
   - Set up React Router with protected routes
   - Implemented navigation between pages

5. **Styling**
   - Created a theme system with styled-components
   - Implemented global styles
   - Used Framer Motion for animations

6. **API Integration**
   - Set up API service for authentication endpoints
   - Created TypeScript interfaces for API responses

## Next Steps

1. **Install Node.js and Dependencies**
   - Follow the instructions in INSTALL_NODEJS.md to install Node.js
   - Run `npm install` to install all dependencies

2. **Fix TypeScript Errors**
   - Address the linter errors related to missing type declarations
   - Install any missing type packages with:
     ```
     npm install --save-dev @types/react @types/react-dom @types/styled-components
     ```

3. **Connect to Backend**
   - Ensure the backend API is running
   - Test the API endpoints with the frontend

4. **Implement Additional Features**
   - Add form validation
   - Implement error handling for API requests
   - Add loading states and spinners

5. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for components
   - Perform integration testing

6. **Deployment**
   - Build the application for production
   - Deploy to a hosting service

## Development Workflow

1. Start the backend server
2. Run `npm start` to start the frontend development server
3. Access the application at http://localhost:3000
4. Make changes to the code and see them reflected in real-time
